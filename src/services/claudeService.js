  **ORIGINAL MATERIAL DETAILS:**
  - Material Type: ${materialType}
  - Subject: ${subject}
  - Grade Level: ${gradeLevel || 'not specified'}
  - WIDA Proficiency Level: ${proficiencyLevel}
  - Content Learning Objectives: ${learningObjectives}
  - Original Text:
  \`\`\`
  ${contentToAdapt}
  \`\`\`

  **ADAPTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
  1.  **Worksheet Structure:** Create a student worksheet with the following sections in this exact order: Title, Background Knowledge, Key Vocabulary, Pre-Reading Activity, Reading Text, Comprehension Activities, and an optional Extension activity.
  2.  **Background Knowledge:** Create a short, simple section with 2-3 bullet points of essential background information a student needs before reading.
  3.  **Key Vocabulary:** Select 3-5 of the most important vocabulary words from the original text. Provide simple, student-friendly definitions.
  4.  **Pre-Reading Activity:** Create a short, interactive activity to engage the student before they read.
  5.  **Reading Text:**
      - Simplify the original text to be appropriate for the target WIDA level.
      - Break long paragraphs into smaller, more manageable chunks.
      - If the text contains a list of items or observations, format them as a bulleted list.
      - **Crucially, find the words from your 'Key Vocabulary' section within this simplified text and make them bold using Markdown (**word**).**
  6.  **Comprehension Activities & Charts:** For any activity that requires a chart or table, you MUST format it for the student worksheet as a **series of bolded headings, each followed by a bulleted list.**
  7.  **Teacher Guide Content:** Create a teacher guide that includes: A COMPLETE ANSWER KEY, LESSON PREPARATION & PACING, OBJECTIVES, SUPPORTS, and ADAPTATIONS.
  
  ${bilingualInstructions}

  **SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS FOR ${proficiencyLevel.toUpperCase()} LEVEL:**
  ${proficiencyAdaptations}

  CRUCIAL FINAL INSTRUCTION: Your response MUST begin with the character '{' and end with the character '}'. The entire output must be only the raw JSON.

  **REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**
  Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON object with three top-level keys: "studentWorksheet", "teacherGuide", and "dynamicWidaDescriptors".

  - "studentWorksheet" value: A single string containing the complete student worksheet, formatted using simple GitHub Flavored Markdown.
  - "teacherGuide" value: A single string containing all the pedagogical notes for the teacher, structured in the specific order previously instructed. This should be plain text.
  - **"dynamicWidaDescriptors" value**: This MUST be a JSON object with a "title" and a "descriptors" array. The "descriptors" array MUST contain 3-5 observable, lesson-specific "Can Do" statements that are directly tied to the activities in the student worksheet.
