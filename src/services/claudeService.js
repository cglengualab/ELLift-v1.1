CONTENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
${learningObjectives}

ORIGINAL MATERIAL:
${contentToAdapt}

ADAPTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. MAINTAIN CONTENT OBJECTIVES: Ensure the adapted material still allows students to achieve the same content learning objectives listed above. Do not lower academic expectations.

2. ADD ELL LANGUAGE OBJECTIVES: Include specific WIDA-aligned language objectives that specify what students will be able to do linguistically (listening, speaking, reading, writing) at the ${proficiencyLevel} level.

3. ALIGN WITH ELL STANDARDS: Follow WIDA English Language Development Standards and research-based ELL best practices.${bilingualInstructions}

SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS FOR ${proficiencyLevel.toUpperCase()} LEVEL:
${proficiencyAdaptations}

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please structure your response as clean, readable text without any markdown formatting. Use the following structure:

ADAPTED MATERIAL:
[The adapted content ready for classroom use - no markdown, just plain text]

CONTENT OBJECTIVES (maintained):
Use bullet points to list each objective clearly:
- [First content objective and how it's maintained]
- [Second content objective and how it's maintained]
- [Additional objectives as needed]

ELL LANGUAGE OBJECTIVES:
Use bullet points to list each language objective with clear domain labels:
- LISTENING: [Specific listening objective for this WIDA level]
- SPEAKING: [Specific speaking objective for this WIDA level]
- READING: [Specific reading objective for this WIDA level]
- WRITING: [Specific writing objective for this WIDA level]
Note: Include only the language domains that are relevant for this specific material type and activity.

ELL SUPPORTS INCLUDED:
Use bullet points to list each support clearly:
- [First scaffold or support added]
- [Second scaffold or support added]
- [Additional supports as needed]

${includeBilingualSupport ? `BILINGUAL VOCABULARY SUPPORT:
Use bullet points to list key terms:
- [English term] = [${nativeLanguage} translation]
- [English term] = [${nativeLanguage} translation]
- [Additional bilingual vocabulary as needed]

` : ''}ASSESSMENT ADAPTATIONS:
Use bullet points to list assessment modifications:
- [First assessment adaptation]
- [Second assessment adaptation]
- [Additional adaptations as needed]

IMPORTANT: Do not use any markdown formatting like **bold**, *italics*, ### headers, or markdown bullet points with -. Use only plain text with regular bullet points (â€¢) and clear section headers that can be easily copied and pasted into any document.`;
